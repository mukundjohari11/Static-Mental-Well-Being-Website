                    <br>
                    💤 Escape Through Sleep: The tendency to seek refuge in sleep highlights a coping mechanism for those facing emotional turmoil.

                    👥 Social Anxiety: Deepika’s concern about breaking down in public reflects a common fear among individuals with mental health issues. The pressure to maintain a façade of normalcy can be exhausting. It’s critical for society to create safe spaces where individuals can express vulnerability without judgment.
                    <br>
                    🎭 The Burden of Masking Emotions: The exhaustion from pretending to be okay can worsen mental health. This insight reveals the hidden struggles many face while trying to meet societal expectations. Encouraging authenticity can alleviate some of this pressure.

                    🤲 Desire for Understanding: Deepika’s wish for someone to recognize her struggles speaks to the universal need for validation. Sharing stories can foster connections and help others feel less alone in their experiences.
